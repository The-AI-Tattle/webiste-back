I think scientific research should be easy to access and to replicate. You can find most of my papers on ArXiv and on
open access platforms - unfortunately, this is not always possible. The code I write is available online and I try to make it easy to use so that everyone can 
benefit from it.

I also try to actively participate in scientific communication. I have many [blog posts online](https://fbvinid.medium.com/), explaining different 
research topics to the public and I am also part of the [ComIntArt (Comitato Intelligenza Artificiale)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMgjppN-5w5OAt67o2jzK7w) 
where I do videos for the Italian public (see for example,  [this video on GPT-3 limits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K--2lHXNiaQ&t=1324s)).
